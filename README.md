# DigitRadio

A custom component for TechniSat's DigitRadio which is based on the Frontier Silicon chip.
The integration expands the built-in [Frontier Silicon Integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/frontier_silicon/) to solve numerous issues I have encountered while using it.

## Installation

You can use [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) to install this component.
To do this you need to add this repository as a "custom repository".
After that you can install it like any other integration.
